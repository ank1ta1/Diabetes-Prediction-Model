# Diabetes-Prediction-Model

This model predicts whether a person has diabetes based on some features namely age, gender, smoking history, blood glucose level, bmi etc. The raw data was highly imbalanced with only 9% positives and to counter this imbalance, different oversampling methods were used viz. random oversampling, SMOTE, Borderline SMOTE, SVM SMOTE and k means SMOTE. The results for each oversampling method were compared.

# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project is a Python-based machine learning project that focuses on predicting diabetes in individuals using a dataset containing various health-related features. It employs data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), logistic regression, and oversampling techniques to improve the model's performance. The code also provides comparisons of different oversampling methods to address the dataset's class imbalance.

## Prerequisites

Before you start using this code, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project (`diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv`) contains various health-related features, including age, gender, smoking history, and other health indicators, to predict whether an individual has diabetes (1) or not (0).

## Results

The code provides various insights into the dataset, including distribution plots, pie charts, and classification reports. It also compares different oversampling methods and displays recall scores to help identify the best method for improving the model's performance.

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed using Python and various machine learning libraries, including scikit-learn and imbalanced-learn.
